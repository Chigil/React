## Requirements

* Create a simple gallery application. It should include:

-   Form with «Author», «Link», «Description» fields and image preview
-   List of all added posts

* Create IndexedDB. All added posts should be saved into it and loaded when you run the app.

## Advanced Requirements

1. Use resource loading methods to prevent adding a post with an invalid image link.
2. Add tags to your posts and ability to filter the gallery by clicking it.
3. Save the post adding date and implement sorting by it.
