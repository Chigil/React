<summary>1. What is npm?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>npm is the package manager for Node.js.
>It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What is npm registry?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js,
>front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. How is npm CLI used?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>The npm CLI tool is used to install, manage and publish the packages. Furthermore, it supports running arbitrary package scripts
>using the binaries from the installed packages, which allows creating various scripts for bundling, testing and linting.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. What is the purpose of code bundling?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>Its main goal is to optimise code delivery in order to make the app load faster.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is code minification?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>It's the process of removing unnecessary characters from the source code without losing its functionality.
>The unnecessary characters include whitespace characters, comments, sometimes block delimiters.
>It also implies renaming the variables to have shorter names.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is source map?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>It's a special file to map the combined and/or minified version to the original one.
>It allows to debug the bundled code as if one was debugging the source code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is webpack? Gulp?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>Webpack is a static file bundling tool. It can work with the most popular module definition patterns including AMD, CommonJS and ES2015 modules.
>Gulp is a JavaScript toolkit used a streaming build system.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What is unit testing?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>Unit testing involves breaking your program into pieces, and subjecting each piece to a series of tests.
Usually tests are run as separate programs, but the method of testing varies, depending on the language, and type of software (GUI, command-line, library).
Most languages have unit testing frameworks, you should look into one for yours.
Tests are usually run periodically, often after every change to the source code. The more often the better, because the sooner you will catch problems.

<details>
<summary>7. What is integration testing?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Test drivers and test stubs are used to assist in Integration Testing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Which test frameworks do you know?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>1. JSUnit: JSUnit is an open source unit testing framework for client-side JavaScript running in the browser. This framework runs on different platforms and >browsers. It fulfills server needs such as;
>Logging results in XML format
>Running JSUnit from JUnit and Ant and more than one or more browser and remote machines as well
>2. Unit.js: It is known as an open source assertion library running on browser and Node.js. It is extremely compatible with other JavaScript Unit Testing >frameworks like Mocha, Karma, Jasmine, QUnit, Protractor, etc. Provides the full documented API of assertion list
>
>3. QUnit: It is used for both client-side as well as server-side JavaScript Unit Testing. This Free framework is used for jQuery projects. It follows Common JS >unit testing Specification for unit testing. It supports the Node Long-term Support Schedule.
>
>4. Jasmine: Jasmine is the behavior-driven development framework for JavaScript unit Testing. It is used for testing both synchronous and asynchronous >JavaScript Code. It does not require DOM and comes with the easy syntax that can be Written for any test.
>
>5. Karma: Karma is an open source productive testing environment. Easy workflow control Running on the command line. Offers the freedom to write the tests with >Jasmine, Mocha, and QUnit. You can run the test on real devices with easy debugging.
>
>6. Mocha: Mocha runs on Node.js and in the browser. Mocha performs asynchronous Testing in a simpler way. Provides accuracy and flexibility in reporting. >Provides tremendous support of rich features such as test-specific timeouts, JavaScript APIs etc.
>
>7. Jest: Jest is used by Facebook so far to test all of the JavaScript code. It provides the 'zero-configuration' testing experience. Supports independent and >non-interrupting running test without any conflict. Do not require any other setup configuration and libraries.
>
>8. AVA: AVA is simple JavaScript Unit Testing Framework. Tests are being run in parallel and serially. Parallel tests run without interrupting each other. AVA >Supports asynchronous testing as well. AVA uses subprocesses to run the test.

<summary>9. What is linting?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>Linting is the process of analyzing source code to flag potential errors, bugs, suspicious constructs and stylistic errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Why is linting important?</summary>

>#### Answer:
>The biggest benefit is the stylistic unification of the code base which makes it easier for any team member to look through the code
>written by other members. Additionally, it makes the introduction of new team members a lot easier.
>Apart from that, it allows to avoid common pitfalls and eliminate the potential bugs and errors.
